# 12v-to-5v-DC-Regulated-POWER-SUPPLY
I designed a Printed Circuit Board for a 12 v DC to 5v DC Regulated Power Supply using 7805 Voltage Regulating IC.I designed this PCB using EasyEDA CAD Software.In my experience , This EasyEDA is comparatively more user-friendly , when comparing to other PCB Designing softwares.


# Components needed to make this 5v 1A DC Regulated Power Supply using our PCB:
1: 7805 Voltage Regulator IC
2: 10uf/16v Electrolytic Capacitor
3: 100uf/25v Electrolytic Capacitor
4: DC Female Connector Jack (Input side)
5: DC Connector ( Output Side )
6: LED ( Indicator )
7: 460 Ω Resistor
8: Heatsink ( In Practical case , 7805 needs a heatsink )
9: PCB

# Upgrades which you can work on :
1: Reverse Polarity Protection.
2: Input Fuse.
3: Transient Protection.
4: Power Good Indicator (Better LED circuit).
5: Thermal Pad Area on PCB.
6: EMI / Noise Reduction.
7: Ultimate Upgrade — Switch Mode Version - Replace 7805 with LM2596 buck converter.

# Happy Engineering!!!!
