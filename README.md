# 12v-to-5v-DC-Regulated-POWER-SUPPLY
I designed a Printed Circuit Board for a 12 v DC to 5v DC Regulated Power Supply using 7805 Voltage Regulating IC.I designed this PCB using EasyEDA CAD Software.In my experience , This EasyEDA is comparatively more user-friendly , when comparing to other PCB Designing softwares.
